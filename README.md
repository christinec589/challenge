# Frontend Challenge

I was tasked with helping create a mobile app called BusyBus, an application operated by the local city transit system that is serves thousands of commuters in a large city.

### UX Design to Development
UX work was done to research and build paper prototypes to test with real people. That was followed by a rigorous dive into the documentation of iOS and Android to gain a better understanding of how these applications are designed.

This design was then coded for Android that incorporates the guidelines for the platform and the visual styling standard.
